# Video Game Battle Simulator

This Python program simulates a battle scenario in a video game. It prompts the player to enter their name, character class, enemy name, and enemy type. Then, it simulates a battle between the player and the enemy, displaying the health points of each after each attack. Finally, it determines the winner based on the remaining health points.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The program is written in Python programming language.

## Programming Concepts Demonstrated

- Input/Output: The program uses input to receive user information and prints output to display battle results.
- Arithmetic Operators: It performs arithmetic operations to calculate damage inflicted during the battle simulation.
- Conditional Statements: The program uses conditional statements to check the validity of user inputs and determine the winner of the battle.
- Loops: It utilizes loops to simulate multiple rounds of battle until one of the characters' health points reach zero.
